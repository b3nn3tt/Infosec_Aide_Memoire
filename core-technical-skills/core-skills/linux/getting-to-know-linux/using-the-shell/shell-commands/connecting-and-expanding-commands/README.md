# Connecting and Expanding Commands

One of the shell's superpowers is the capability to **redirect** the input and output of commands to and from other commands and files. To make all this magic happen, the shell employs these things called **metacharacters**. Think of them as special characters with VIP access, designed to link commands or jazz things up a bit.

Metacharacters include the following:

* Pipe character `|`
* Ampersand `&`
* Semicolon `;`
* Right parenthesis `)`
* Left parenthesis `(`
* Less than sign `<`
* Greater than sign `>`

In the sections that follow, we'll dive into the art of wielding metacharacters on the command line and reshaping the actions of commands. Strap in!
