This value changes each time you change directories using the cd command                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| RANDOM          | Accessing this variable causes a random number to be generated. The number is between 0 and 99999                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| SECONDS         | This is the number of seconds since the time the shell was started                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| SHLVL           | This is the number of shell levels associated with the current shell session. When you log in to the shell, the SHLVL is 1. Each time you start a new bash command (by, for example, using su to become a new user, or by simply typing bash), this number is incremented                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| TMOUT           | This can be set to a number representing the number of seconds the shell can be idle without receiving input. After the number of seconds is reached, the shell exits. This security feature makes it less likely for unattended shells to be accessed by unauthorized people. (This must be set in the login shell for it actually to cause the shell to log out the user)                                                                                                                                                                                             |
