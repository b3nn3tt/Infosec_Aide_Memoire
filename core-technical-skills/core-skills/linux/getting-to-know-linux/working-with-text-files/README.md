# Working with Text Files

In this section, we will look at:

* Using vim and vi to edit text files
* Using Nano to edit text files
* Text manipulation tools like sed, awk, cut, grep and xclip

When the UNIX system, on which Linux was based, was created, most information was managed on the system in plain-text files. Thus, it was critical for users to know how to use tools for searching for and within plain-text files and to be able to change and configure those files.

Today, configuration of Linux systems can still be done by editing plain-text files.

Whether you are modifying files in the `/etc` directory to configure a local service, or editing [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) inventory files to configure sets of host computers, plain-text files are still in common use for those tasks. Before you can become a full-fledged system administrator, you need to be able to use a plain-text editor. The fact that most professional Linux servers donâ€™t even have a graphical interface available makes the need for editing of plain-text configuration files with a non-graphical text editor necessary.
