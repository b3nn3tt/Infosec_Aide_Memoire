# Adding Text

To get into **input** mode, type an input command letter. To begin, type any of the following letters:&#x20;

* **`a:`** The add command. With this command, you can input text that starts to the right of the cursor
* **`A:`** The add at end command. With this command, you can input text starting at the end of the current line
* **`i:`** The insert command. With this command, you can input text that starts to the left of the cursor
* **`I:`** The insert at beginning command. With this command, you can input text that starts at the beginning of the current line.
* **`o:`** The open below command. This command opens a line below the current line and puts you in insert mode.
* **`O:`** The open above command. This command opens a line above the current line and puts you in insert mode.
