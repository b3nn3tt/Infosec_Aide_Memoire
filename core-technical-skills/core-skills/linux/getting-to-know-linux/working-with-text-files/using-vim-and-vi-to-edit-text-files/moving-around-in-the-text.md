# Moving Around in the Text

To move around in the text, you can use the up, down, right, and left arrows. However, many of the keys for moving around are right under your fingertips when they are in typing position:

* **`Arrow keys:`** Move the cursor up, down, left, or right in the file one character at a time. To move left and right, you can also use Backspace and the spacebar, respectively. If you prefer to keep your fingers on the keyboard, move the cursor with `h` (left), `l`(right), `j` (down), or `k` (up)
* **`w:`** Moves the cursor to the beginning of the next word (delimited by spaces, tabs, or punctuation)
* **`W:`** Moves the cursor to the beginning of the next word (delimited by spaces or tabs)
* **`b:`** Moves the cursor to the beginning of the previous word (delimited by spaces, tabs, or punctuation)
* **`B:`** Moves the cursor to the beginning of the previous word (delimited by spaces or tabs)
* **`0:`** Moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line
* **`$:`** Moves the cursor to the end of the current line
* **`H:`** Moves the cursor to the upper-left corner of the screen (first line on the screen)
* **`M:`** Moves the cursor to the first character of the middle line on the screen
* **`L:`** Moves the cursor to the lower-left corner of the screen (last line on the screen).
