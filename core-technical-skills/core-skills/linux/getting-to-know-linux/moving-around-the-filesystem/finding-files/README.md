# Finding Files

Even the most basic of Linux installations can result in a system that contains thousands upon thousands of files. Therefore it's essential to have tools for locating and searching for files. You can use commands like `locate` to find files by name, `find` to search for files using more varied or complex criteria, and `grep` to search for specific text within files to help with these tasks.

Take some time to get familiar with their use - knowing which tool to use in different scenarios can save you a LOT of time!
