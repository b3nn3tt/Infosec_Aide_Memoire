# Killing and Recining Processes

Just as you can change the behaviour of a process using graphical tools such as System Monitor, you can also use command-line tools to kill a process or change its CPU priority. The `kill` command can send a **kill signal** to any process to end it, assuming you have permission to do so. It can also send different signals to a process to otherwise change its behaviour.

The **nice** and **renice** commands can be used to set or change the processor priority of a process.
