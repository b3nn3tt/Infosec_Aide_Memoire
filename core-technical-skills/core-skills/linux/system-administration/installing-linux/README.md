# Installing Linux

Before we do anything else, we need to get a working environment up and running. Therefore, we need to learn to install Linux. We will look specifically at:

* Choosing an installation method
* Installing a single- or multi-boot system
* Performing a Live media installation of Fedora
* Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux
* Understanding cloud-based installations
* Partitioning the disk for installation
* Understanding the GRUB boot loader

Installing Linux has become a fairly easy thing to do - if you are starting with a computer that is up to spec (hard disk, RAM, CPU, and so on) and you don’t mind totally erasing your hard drive. With cloud computing and virtualisation, installation can be even simpler. It allows you to bypass traditional installation and spin a Linux system up or down within a few minutes by adding metadata to prebuilt images.

This section starts off with a simple installation on a physical computer from Live media, and progresses to more complex installation types. To ease you into the subject of installing Linux, I cover three different ways of installing Linux and step you through each process:

### &#x20;Installing from Live Media

A Linux Live media ISO is a single, read-only image that contains everything you need to start a Linux operating system. That image can be burned to a DVD or USB drive, and then booted from. With the Live media, you can totally ignore your computer’s hard disk; in fact, you can run Live media on a system with no hard disk. After you are running the Live Linux system, some Live media ISOs allow you to launch an application that permanently installs the contents of the Live medium to your hard disk.

### &#x20;**Installing from Installation Media (DVD or USB)**

An installation media, available with Fedora, RHEL, Ubuntu, and other Linux distributions, offers more flexible ways of installing Linux. In particular, instead of just copying the whole Live media contents to your computer, with installation media you can choose exactly which software package you want.

### &#x20;**Installing in the Enterprise**

Sitting in front of a computer and clicking through installation questions is somewhat inconvenient if you are installing a single system. But what if you need to install dozens or hundreds of Linux systems? What if you want to install those systems in particular ways that need to be repeated over multiple installations? Later in this section, we will look at efficient ways of installing multiple Linux systems using network installation features and kickstart files.
