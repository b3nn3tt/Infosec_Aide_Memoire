# Installing Linux

Installing Linux onto a computer is pretty straightforward these days. As long as your machine’s got the right stuff under the hood (like a decent hard disk, enough RAM, a solid CPU), and you’re cool with giving your hard drive a clean slate, you’re all set. Plus, with the wizardry of cloud computing and virtualisation, you can sidestep the whole installation song and dance. Just sprinkle some metadata on prebuilt images, and you can have a Linux system up and running - or tucked away - quicker than you can knock a brew together.

To kick things off, we'll ease you into the Linux installation party starting with a basic set-up on a physical machine using **Live media**. Then, as you get comfortable, we'll venture into the more intricate styles of installations. To make sure you're well-prepped, I'll guide you through three different Linux installation methods step by step:



## Installing from Live Media

A Linux Live media ISO serves as a comprehensive, read-only snapshot containing all the essentials to boot a Linux operating system. You can transfer this image onto a DVD or, more commonly these days, a USB drive, and use it to boot your computer. The beauty of Live media is that it operates independently of your computer's hard disk; you can even use it on a computer without a hard disk installed. While running the Linux system from Live media, some ISOs offer the option to initiate a permanent installation, transferring the Live system onto your hard disk for ongoing use. It's kind of like a "try before you buy" approach that I quite like!



## **Installing from Installation Media (DVD or USB)**

Installation media, which you'll find accompanying distributions like Fedora, RHEL, and Ubuntu, provides a more adaptable approach to getting Linux onto your machine. Rather than just cloning the entirety of a Live media onto your system, installation media gives you the choice. It allows you to select the specific software packages you want, ensuring a tailored fit for your Linux setup.

## **Installing in the Enterprise**

If you're setting up just one computer, manually ticking boxes and answering prompts during installation can be a pain in the... yeah. But, imagine the hassle if you're tasked with installing Linux on **hundreds** of machines! And, what if each one needs a bespoke setup, with the process replicated precisely each time...&#x20;

Not to worry – we'll delve into the nifty world of network installation methods and kickstart files a little later, designed to take the pain out of mass Linux deployments.
