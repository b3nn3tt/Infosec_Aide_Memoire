# Reading User Input

Interactive user input is a vital feature if your scripts are going to provide rich functionality. To facilitate this sort of data capture, we use the `read` command:

{% code title="Leveraging the read command to capture user input" %}
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "What is your name"

read name

echo "Hello $name"
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also use the `-p` and `-sp` options to set a prompt or silent prompt as necessary
{% endhint %}

{% code title="Example Script" %}
```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p 'Username: ' username
read -sp 'Password: ' password

echo "Hello $username, your password is now set to $password"
```
{% endcode %}
